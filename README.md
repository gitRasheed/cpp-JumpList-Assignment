A C++ implementation of a specialized linked list variant that combines regular linked list functionality with additional "jump" pointers for optimized traversal. Not the fastest but designed to test C++ skills for a university assignment.

## Key Features

- Maintains sorted string elements
- Optimized search operations using jump pointers
- Memory-efficient node management
- Basic operations: insert, delete, find, traverse
